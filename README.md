# Introduction
<a href="https://fabledgame.com/en/pirates-outlaws/details" title = "Pirates Outlaws" alt="Link to Pirates Outlaws."> is a card game by Fabled Game Studio. I manually collected the card information and descriptions into a csv file. I wanted to to figure out what the average damage was for different card types in the newer updates and to figure out how the older cards compare to the newer ones.
